# Portfolio - Geir Olafsson 
I have a multidisciplinary background across many industrial fields and academia. During this time I have developed and extensive skillset in data science and computer programming. I have extensive experience in Python, Matlab and R generating command tools, data processing classes, dashboards and graphical user interfaces. I have experience also in C for embedded systems.
For the past four years managed the GitLab server for my research team. I am comfortable in using git via command line, apps, managing and setting up new repos and integrating CI/CD pipelines in GitLab or actions in Github. 
I addition I a have a working knowledge of docker and run multiple docker containers locally at home via docker compose, managed using Portainer. 

Within this portofolio you will find a selection of projects I have developed in Matlab, Python and C. However I have an extensive selection of additonal projects so if there is something you would like to ask me the please do at [mailto:geirolafsson88@gmail.com](geirolafsson88@gmail.com)!
